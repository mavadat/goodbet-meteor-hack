# Progress
Capturing important moments as I progress through this. I have already spent few hours reading about Meteor. I am impressed by how quickly nice little apps can be put together with Meteor without typical distractions. Let's see how it pays off for my little Goodbet application.

- First commit i.e. Big Bang. I left Meteor stuff in place with no change to capture in history. Since I intend to use Bootstrap and more modules than everything in *myapp.js* I will clean it up soon.
- An empty CSS file doesn't help anyone. So just deleted *goodbet.css*. [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com) seem to be respected Meteor package management repository. [twbs:booitstrap](https://atmospherejs.com/twbs/bootstrap) says **official** and has highest rating so I feel comfortable already. Let's install the package now.
