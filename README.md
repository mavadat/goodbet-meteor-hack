# Progress Log
Capturing important moments as I progress through this. I have already spent few hours reading about Meteor. I am impressed by how quickly nice little apps can be put together with Meteor without typical distractions. Let's see how it pays off for my little Goodbet application.

First commit i.e. Big Bang. I left Meteor stuff in place with no change to capture in history. Since I intend to use Bootstrap and more modules than everything in *myapp.js* I will clean it up soon.
